The Maine Spaceport Initiative is a consultancy to the Maine State Legislature, exploring the feasibility and financial benefit of constructing a Spaceport. The Spaceport Initiative tasked six Data Analytics graduate students at Northeastern Univeristy to investigate potential revenue and use-cases.

I was responsible for creating two models: one that predicted "launch windows" (or favorable weather opportunities for launching rockets and (2) a revenue prediction monte carlo simulation based of the predictions from the first model.

This data was presented to the state via the Maine Spaceport Initiatieve.
